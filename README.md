# nodejs-boilerplate-test

Steps I took:
* After initializing the git repo and having nodejs installed do _npm init_ to create a package.json file (the place where you'll install all your modules)
* type _npm install -g express-generator_ (this will install the module which allows you to create an express application skeleton and (the -g tag makes the command global)
* create your express application skeleton by typing _express --view=hbs --git_ (this creates files in the current directory with a .gitignore, or type _express -h_ to get the list of other options if you don't want to use handlebars)
* gitignore node_modules and anything other config files generated by your IDE
* type _npm install_ to install all the modules generated by express-generator in the package.json file
* also type _npm install -g nodemon_ if you want to make debugging easier. It automatically restarts the server everytime you save the file; so when initially starting the server, instead of typing _node app.js_ type _nodemon app.js_ instead
